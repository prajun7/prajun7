ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prajun77

**Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack**

I am planning to gain more real-life coding experience by working on various projects. And I am interested in collaborating with other computer scientists.

Coming all the way from Nepal, I am a pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science with minor in Mathematics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

- Proficient Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, MATLAB, Scheme 
- Web Frameworks: Express.js, Flask
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Technologies: Git, Postman, pgAdmin, MongoDB Compass

I am seeking the role of a Software Developer where I can contribute towards the organizational goals through my analytical skills and knowledge acquired by working on real-life projects using the JavaScript MERN Stack.

As a Software Developer, I would bring these skills to develop software that exceeds the expectations of clients and customers and drive real business results. With each new experience, I am eagerly looking forward to expanding my skills and knowledge.
